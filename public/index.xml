&lt;h1 id=&#34;good-routines-easy-routines&#34;&gt;Good routines = Easy routines&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the value of a highly consistent routine in several areas, in the last few years: bedtime, mealtime, school subjects, bookkeeping for the business, fitness, etc.  It seems that everybody knows that the trick to success in any pursuit, isn&amp;rsquo;t a trick - it&amp;rsquo;s consistent adherence to a good schedule.  This isn&amp;rsquo;t any less true in the important work of cultivating the living Word in yourself, or in your children.  Daily review of material, even if it isn&amp;rsquo;t as varied or fast-moving as you would prefer, is the ticket to year-over-year success, as more and more material is tucked away in the heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What isn&amp;rsquo;t appreciated, is that the &lt;em&gt;more accessible&lt;/em&gt; a routine is, the &lt;em&gt;easier&lt;/em&gt; it is to stick to it.  I tend to set goals way high.  If I try to get settled in an incredibly demanding fitness routine, failure inevitably results; I get overawed, frustrated, disappointed at a goal I can&amp;rsquo;t reasonably reach.  But if I make a routine out of small exercises scattered throughout the day - for example, while slowly listening through the phone tree of a company switchboard, watching a pot getting ready to boil, or waiting for the girls to put their shoes and coats on - before the day is out I&amp;rsquo;ve done the lion&amp;rsquo;s share of a workout, with no time lost, and no sweaty clothes.  But how about those sore muscles!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology is a gift - let&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; it, not &lt;em&gt;abuse&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal at Scripture Audio is to make your routine of regular Scripture intake as simple as going online and clicking &amp;lsquo;Play&amp;rsquo;.  Technology is a gift - let&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; it, not &lt;em&gt;abuse&lt;/em&gt; it.  Our intent is remove as many stumbling blocks from your path as possible, and maximize the impact the routine has on you.  We keep it simple.  Because routines may be the key to success, but &lt;em&gt;ease of use&lt;/em&gt; is what makes sure that key, stays on your key ring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you use our material or find another path, find a way to smooth down that path as much as possible.  Remember that your goal is not to be a hero - it&amp;rsquo;s to be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;here-we-go-2017&#34;&gt;Here we go, 2017&amp;hellip;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m excited.  It&amp;rsquo;s been a solid 10 years since I&amp;rsquo;ve built a site from scratch, and it&amp;rsquo;s great to see how the tech has changed.  After a lot of knocking about, I&amp;rsquo;ve settled on a great static site engine from the good folks at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s simple enough that I can actually wrap my mind around most of it, and also simple enough that adding content should be pretty painless.  Big shout out for Hugo &amp;ndash; I would recommend it for anyone looking for a fast-rendering, lightweight engine for blogs or simpler websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to getting to know you all, and thanks for stopping by.  Jonathon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;purpose&#34;&gt;Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scripture Audio is dedicated to helping churches, families and individuals absorb the Word of God in context of a rich interaction with classical music.  Our secondary goal is to bring amateur musicians back into service to the believing community by arranging local, on-the-ground recording sessions, joining both the production and consumption of music and Scripture narration in an enjoyable, lasting, and localized process of culture building.  We believe in the power of recordings to enable Christians to grow in their faith, teach their children, share their gifts, remember the past, and encourage the brethren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rationale&#34;&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Christians are taught to learn the Word in a music-drenched way (Col. 3:16 &amp;ndash; our theme verse.)  Memorizing individual verses and verse references of the Bible has its place, but if we believe that the Scriptures are both living and active, and if we desire this Divine life to spring up within us, we&amp;rsquo;re advised to imbibe the Scriptures in a musical way, preferably in large enough &amp;lsquo;chunks&amp;rsquo; that we grasp &lt;em&gt;the context&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scriptures aren&amp;rsquo;t specific as to &lt;em&gt;what this sounds like;&lt;/em&gt; but in the spirit of bringing to God the best our culture has to offer, we propose to help you and your family choose the best of traditional music as an aid not only in your Bible &lt;em&gt;proficiency&lt;/em&gt;, but in your &lt;em&gt;love for the Word.&lt;/em&gt;  If you ever came across a line in your Bible which had been set to a familiar, perhaps beloved song in your churchgoing past, you know the &amp;lsquo;heart in your mouth&amp;rsquo; feeling as the words suddenly leap off the page and stir the deeper reaches of your heart.  This is the highest and best purpose of music in God&amp;rsquo;s world; men and women were created to resonate best with the truth, when accompanied by the best compositions which resonate with that truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the highest and best purpose of music in God&amp;rsquo;s world; men and women were created to resonate best with the truth, when music which best resonates with that truth accompanies it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34;&gt;How it works&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You listen to audio tracks.  That&amp;rsquo;s about it.  Our organizing principle is, &lt;em&gt;If it isn&amp;rsquo;t easy, we won&amp;rsquo;t do it&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;, and we&amp;rsquo;ve arranged it all around that philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn a portion of Scripture, we have you start out listening to a complete narration of the text, accompanied by a carefully scored recording of classical music.  Over time, slightly altered tracks give you less and less of the Scripture narration, so your mind, clued-in by familiarity with the music, begins to &amp;lsquo;fill in&amp;rsquo; the missing pieces, until you arrive at full mastery of the material.  By this point, the music is typically an unnecessary &amp;lsquo;crutch&amp;rsquo;, since the narration &lt;em&gt;is never rhymed, or set to poetry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tracks can be listened to in the car, while jogging, on an iPod or cell phone, or over whatever Bluetooth/mp3/phonograph/newfangled device you use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to listen in a family context, if possible, because while you are learning the Scriptures together, you are also growing in a shared, cultural experience of the music &lt;em&gt;in connection&lt;/em&gt; with that passage &amp;ndash; and musical experiences are always best, when they are shared.  The gift of love for music, is a gift meant to be passed on.&lt;/p&gt;
