# Heritage Church CPC

In February 2017 we will be at Heritage Church in Centerville TN.  Recordings are scheduled for **Psalms #15, 23, 103 and 139.**  I'm looking forward to working with all the participating musicians!

## For Musicians...

The weekend of February 20'th *(still being confirmed... hang tight)* we'll be recording four pieces of music to accompany the production of four Psalms, which we hope many folks in your community will use as an aid in Scripture memory.  These are fully produced recordings and I expect a high level of focus and ensemble as we work toward giving our best, in service to the church!

We will work two coaching sessions into our weekend, with the help of cellist Rebecca Landell-Reed, *viola de gambist* and cellist for [Baroque ensemble, **Apollo's Fire**](http://www.apollosfire.org).  She will be Skyping into our rehearsals and giving you feedback on musicality and interpretation, before we get down to recording our final tracks.

Here's a quick video introduction to the music we'll be recording.
