## Purpose

Scripture Audio is dedicated to helping churches, families and individuals absorb the Word of God through the enriching power of classical music.  We believe in the power of music to enable Christians to deeply drink of the meaning of Scripture, to grow in their faith, teach their children, share their gifts, remember the past, and encourage each other.  Our secondary goal is to bring amateur musicians back into service to the believing community by arranging local, on-the-ground recording sessions, joining both the production and consumption of music and Scripture narration in an enjoyable, lasting, and localized process of culture building.  

## Rationale

Christians are taught to learn the Word in a music-drenched way (Col. 3:16 -- our theme verse.)  Memorizing individual verses and verse references of the Bible is always appropriate, but if we believe that the Scriptures are both living and active, we're advised to imbibe the Scriptures in a musical way, preferably in large enough 'chunks' that we grasp *the context*.  

## What music?
The Scriptures aren't specific as to what appropriate music suited for this task sounds like; but in the spirit of bringing to God the best our culture has to offer, we want to help you and your family choose the best of traditional music as an aid not only in your Bible *proficiency*, but in your *love for the Word.*  If you ever came across a line in your Bible which had been set to a familiar, perhaps beloved song in your churchgoing past, you know the 'heart in your mouth' feeling as the words suddenly leap off the page and stir the deeper reaches of your heart.  This is the highest and best purpose of music in God's world; men and women were created to resonate best with the truth, when accompanied by the best compositions which resonate with that truth.

This is the highest and best purpose of music in God's world; men and women were created to resonate best with the truth, when music which best resonates with that truth accompanies it.

## How it works
You listen to audio tracks!  Our organizing principle is, *If it isn't easy, we won't do it...*, and we've arranged it all around that philosophy.

If you want to learn a portion of Scripture, you'll start out listening to a complete narration of the text, accompanied by some great music.  Over time, slightly altered tracks give you less and less of the Scripture narration, so your mind, clued-in by familiarity with the music, begins to 'fill in' the missing pieces, until you arrive at full mastery of the material.  By this point, the music is typically an unnecessary 'crutch', since the narration is never rhymed, altered, or set to poetry.

These tracks can be listened to in the car, while jogging, on an iPod or cell phone, or over whatever digital device you choose.

## Family
We encourage you to listen in a family context, if possible!  While you are learning the Scriptures together, you are also growing in a shared, cultural experience of the music *in connection* with that passage -- and musical experiences are always best, when they are shared.  The gift of love for music, is a gift meant to be passed on.
