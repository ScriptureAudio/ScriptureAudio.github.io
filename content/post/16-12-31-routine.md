# Good routines = Easy routines

I've seen the value of a highly consistent routine in several areas, in the last few years: bedtime, mealtime, school subjects, bookkeeping for the business, fitness, etc.  It seems that everybody knows that the trick to success in any pursuit, isn't a trick - it's consistent adherence to a good schedule.  This isn't any less true in the important work of cultivating the living Word in yourself, or in your children.  Daily review of material, even if it isn't as varied or fast-moving as you would prefer, is the ticket to year-over-year success, as more and more material is tucked away in the heart.

What isn't appreciated, is that the *more accessible* a routine is, the *easier* it is to stick to it.  I tend to set goals way high.  If I try to get settled in an incredibly demanding fitness routine, failure inevitably results; I get overawed, frustrated, disappointed at a goal I can't reasonably reach.  But if I make a routine out of small exercises scattered throughout the day - for example, while slowly listening through the phone tree of a company switchboard, watching a pot getting ready to boil, or waiting for the girls to put their shoes and coats on - before the day is out I've done the lion's share of a workout, with no time lost, and no sweaty clothes.  But how about those sore muscles!
