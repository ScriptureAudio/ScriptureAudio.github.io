# Tablet stand

When I do Scripture memory work with my kids, I find that a **good stand** for my Samsung Note tablet to be *indispensable.*  It's hard to get visiblity when the tablet is lying flat down on the table, and when in that position the sound is just terrible.  After trying a couple different stands I've settled on the **[Bobj Folding Tablet Stand](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BKM9NLO/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1)** as the "just right - do anything" solution. It works with any phone or tablet, it's not too big and it's *not too small either*... it has a really chunky heft and the plastic is flexible enough that it won't get destroyed.  The hinge in the middle is tensioned with a steel hex bolt (!!) and as it gets looser over time I've had to adjust it back into the right amount of friction - but that doesn't bother me.  The foam plastic bumper on the back side did fall off several times - I glued it back on, but frankly it doesn't really do anything anyway.  It holds my phone or tablet in either vertical or horizontal position, and there's nothing to malfunction really.  For $16 I'm pretty pleased - when we go on trips it always rides along.
