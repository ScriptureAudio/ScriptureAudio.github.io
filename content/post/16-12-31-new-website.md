# Here we go, 2017...

So I'm excited.  It's been a solid 10 years since I've built a site from scratch, and it's great to see how the tech has changed.  After a lot of knocking about, I've settled on a great static site engine from the good folks at **[Hugo](http://www.gohugo.io)**.  It's simple enough that I can actually wrap my mind around most of it, and also simple enough that adding content should be pretty painless.  Big shout out for Hugo -- I would recommend it for anyone looking for a fast-rendering, lightweight engine for blogs or simpler websites.

Looking forward to getting to know you all, and thanks for stopping by.  Jonathon
