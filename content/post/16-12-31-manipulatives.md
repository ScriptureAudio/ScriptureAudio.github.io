# Are manipulatives distracting or helpful/

My little ones struggle with focus during Bible time.  Even while singing along with the music, berating *each other for not focusing* (go figure?), and loudly narrating the Psalms they enjoy the most (every kid loves to shout!), their little minds constantly wander.  This is a problem, because lack of focus begets poor retention, poor attitudes, and tempts me to frustration.

Our [Family format](2016/12/31/16/12-31-family-format) style of Bible time involves switching-off between the two girls, such that they alternate [narrating](/2016/12/31/16-12-31-definitions/) each in turn.  As explained in the Family Format article, the benefits of having everyone in the room at once are exponentially related to the size of the group; even when a child isn't narrating, they are still half-way listening to the one who is; and those of us with *competitive-minded children* will immediately grasp the manner in which the nearest-born who remembers a text more accurately will *jump down the throat* of the one trying to narrate, taking great pride in correcting her.

But sometimes competitiveness isn't enough to keep their focus; sometimes the idle child can't stand not being fully engaged, front-and-center, in the proceedings.  She starts to fidget, fuss, pull her hair, pour milk on the floor, or push buttons on the phone.  In this case, I would **recommend trying manipulatives.**  As in, stuff she can do with her hands.  Much like a quiet toy allowed during a long sermon at church, kids waiting their turn to narrate sometimes pay better attention to the older children's narration when quietly occupied doing something *manual*.

I recommend crayons & paper to start with.  My girls can't narrate effectively while coloring, but if it's not their turn, they are free to color as much as they like.  There are days when it gets out of hand, and back into the box go the crayons... but 8 days out of 10, a stack of paper and a pile of those hideous glitter crayons do the job of maintaining *relative* peace and quiet.  What I now believe is that, *most of the time*, when the hands are switched on the ears are not *necessarily* switched off... and in fact the ears may be *more* receptive.  The idle but quiet child is not just hearing the music and the Scripture track; they are absorbing the sounds to their sibling narrate - and this is the secret weapon to doubling or tripling the reward of your efforts: siblings listen to each other intently, and are attuned to the highest level to their motions and activities.  This can be an unending source of misery, but during Bible time, with some manipulatives to calm the troubled waters, it can also be a great source of blessing.

As an added bonus: it was very soon after my little ones learned Psalm 23, that many of the pictures in the stack of finished crayon drawings included far fewer princesses, princes, unicorns, persons on horseback, pink gowns and fairy crowns; instead we saw many more sheep, quiet fields, streams, approaching enemies, and shepherds holding rod and staff.

My favorite, after some time in Genesis studying creation and the fall of Adam & Eve after they ate the forbidden fruit, was when A drew a picture of two tall trees, with the following labels crudely drawn pointing to each tree:  "EET THIS, NOTT THAT !!!"
