# Definition:  Narration, recitation, internalization

We make the distinction between passively or semi-passively **listening** along with a text of Scripture, as during a sermon or devotional, and **narration** which is  *active participation in the reading*, by speaking the text along with the reader, to the best of the ability.  Much like a young child babbles and speaks in broken sentences before more-or-less "mastering" English grammar and syntax, narration is simply the first stage of growth as a text takes hold in a person.

**Recitation**; which is the ability to extemporaneously speak the entirety of a text without assistance.

The goal is always **internalization** of the full *meaning and content* of a text, to the point where one can make appropriate application of it in another conversation, refer to its details accurately, or provide something of a summary exposition.
