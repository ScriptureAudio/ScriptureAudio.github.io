&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are entering the third week of memorizing Psalm 15, and by this point you might be familiar with the flow of the thoughts and be able to complete many of the phrases, as long as you can catch the first few words of a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded a new track which is edited for two reasons.  The first reason is that a few more words have been removed, to strengthen your memory and retention a little more.  The second reason is that MSB kindly brought to my attention that I mixed up the editing at the tail end of the psalm, and had transposed the phrasing of the final verse!  It has been corrected, and I apologize for the error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you are having a great week!  Jonathon&lt;/p&gt;
